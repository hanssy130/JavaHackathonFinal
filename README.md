## About
We chose this team name because we enjoyed saying it around each other. Read the below for a 

The Mandarin expression《干嘛》(pinyin: gàn má) is a colloquial phrase that's used very commonly.
It is used to ask "What're you doing?"

From [https://www.echineselearning.com/blog/what-are-you-doing-using-the-phrase-ganma](https://www.echineselearning.com/blog/what-are-you-doing-using-the-phrase-ganma),

“干(gàn)” means “to do” while”吗(ma)” is a particle added at the end of sentences to denote a question, as in “你好吗?(nǐhǎoma?)” for “How are you?” and “可以吗?(kěyǐma?)” meaning “Is it ok?”

When combined, the characters “干吗?(gànmá?)” can generally take on two meanings. The first usage of “干吗?(gànmá?)” is relatively straightforward, as you might guess from the direct translation of the two characters. It can be used to ask about what someone is doing at the moment or what he or she wants to do.

| Example 1 | Example 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Nǐ zài gànmá? | Zhèshì wǒde diànnǎo, nǐxiǎng gànmá? |
| 你  在 干吗？ | 这是    我的   电脑，    你想     干吗？|
| What are you doing? | This is my computer, what do you want to do with it? |
